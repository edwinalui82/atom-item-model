                <p>Few people consciously contemplate the drug that they ingest daily in their
                    morning coffee, afternoon tea, or daily soda. However, many people consume at
                    least some caffeine everyday; in fact, it is the world's most pervasive drug. In
                    the United States alone, consumers spend over 50 billion dollars on caffeinated
                    sodas alone each year. Consumers ingest caffeine in both small and large
                    amounts: from the 25 mg in an average chocolate bar, to the 200 mg in the
                    average cup of brewed coffee.</p>
                <p>The widespread use of caffeine is distressing to some scientists and medical
                    researchers. Caffeine raises blood pressure, which can in turn lead to higher
                    rates of heart disease. Caffeine is also a diuretic, and can lead to dehydration
                    if consumed in large amounts. Further, some studies have linked caffeine use to
                    increased rates of cancer and osteoporosis, a disorder where calcium is leached
                    from bones.</p>
                <p>However, other scientists point to the many benefits of caffeine. The drug can
                    promote alertness and reduce short term fatigue. It also has the ability to
                    fight headache pain and improve mood. These scientists also contend that most of
                    the purported ill effects are minimal. They point out that caffeine does not
                    dehydrate when consumed in small amounts. Further, they suggest that caffeine's
                    effect on blood pressure is temporary, and that the amount of calcium lost from
                    bones could be replaced by the addition of a few tablespoons of milk to one's
                    diet per day.</p>

                                    of or against caffeine use, without asserting any opinion as to

                                    detail, not the author's “primary purpose.”</p>
                                <p>TAKEAWAY:&#160;Nearly every GMAT passage is accompanied by a

                                <p>
                                    <b>Analyze the Question Stem:</b>
                                </p>
                                <p> The words “most likely agree” signal that this is an Inference
                                    question. Inference questions ask for the answer choice that
                                    must be true given what is stated in the passage. </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b> Research the Relevant Text: </b>
                                </p>
                                <p> The question asks for what the scientists in the third paragraph
                                    would agree with, so look at the passage map to determine their
                                    point of view. They think that caffeine has benefits, and that
                                    the supposed drawbacks cited by other scientists aren't that
                                    bad. Since this is an open-ended question, further research may
                                    be needed based on the choices.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Make a Prediction:</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>The right answer can't be specifically predicted, but keep these
                                    scientists' point of view in mind when evaluating the
                                    choices.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Evaluate the Answer Choices:</b>
                                </p>
                                <p><b>(A)</b> is the correct answer; the scientists in the third
                                    passage believe that drinking extra milk can offset the calcium
                                    loss caused by caffeine.</p>
                                <p>(B) and (C) are both extreme statements. These scientists believe
                                    that most ill effects of caffeine are minimal, but that doesn't
                                    mean that all caffeine users are safe from heart disease or that
                                    there are no ill effects.</p>
                                <p>(D) may be tempting, since, according to these
                                    scientists,caffeine can increase alertness and reduce fatigue.
                                    However, there's no support for the fact that this would happen
                                    "immediately" or that that a caffeine user would be more alert
                                    than anyone who hadn't had caffeine.</p>
                                <p> The scientists mentioned in the third paragraph do not address
                                    the cancer causing or fighting properties of caffeine, so (E) is
                                    unsupported. </p>
                                <p>TAKEAWAY:&#160;Avoid extreme statements in Inference questions,
                                    unless there is extreme support in the passage.</p>
