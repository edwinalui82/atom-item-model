                    <p>Zero-order with respect to reactant A means that the rate of the reaction does not depend on the concentration of A. That means that if the concentration of A is increased by a factor of four, the reaction rate should not change at all. &#160;The correct answer is&#160;<b>(D)</b>.</p>
