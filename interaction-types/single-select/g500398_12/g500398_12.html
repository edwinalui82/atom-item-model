                    <p><b>Read the Original Sentence Carefully,
                        Looking for Errors:</b></p>
                    <p>The word "from" at the end of the underlined portion is unidiomatic. The correct idiom is <i>when something happens</i>, not <i>from something happens</i>.</p>
                    <p><b>Scan and Group the Answer Choices:</b></p>
                    <p>There are two noticeable 3-2 splits in this sentence.  Looking to the location of the error, there is a split between the prepositions "from" and "when" at the end of the underlined portion of the sentence.  Choices (A) and (E) retain the error and will be eliminated.</p>
                    <p>The other split is located after the words "sulfur dioxide."  Choices (A), (B), and (C) are the correct side of this split — we <i>do</i> need the verb "is" after "sulfur dioxide." Choices ( be eliminated.</p>
                    <p><b>Eliminate Wrong Answer Choices:</b></p>
                    <p>The first split eliminates choices (A) and (E), and the second split eliminates (D).  The correct answer is either (B) or (C).  However, (C) must also be eliminated, since the use of the word “and” changes the meaning of the sentence by implying that the formation of the sulfur dioxide is a separate event from the chemical reaction.  Answer Choice <b>(B)</b> is the only choice remaining, and it is correct.</p>
                    <p>TAKEAWAY: Use the results of your scan to identify differences among the choices that must be correctly resolved. In this case, the scan quickly identified "from" versus "when" and the inclusion or exclusion of "is."</p>
